# Nimble Coding Test: Passwords

### Background:

The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate your ability to write good code in as "realistic" of an environment as possible.  We feel a programming exercise where you can use your own environment is more representative of your ability to be a productive engineer than coding during an interview on the white board.

In evaluating this exercise we look for the following, in priority order :

1.  Does the program work as specified --ie, given the input file, does it produce the output?
2.  Is the code easy to read and maintain?
3.  Is the code written in a way that will perform well, scale well under load?


### Instructions:

Please complete the programming exercise as specified in the attach file:   Programming Problem, passwords.htm

You'll also find an input file say.in. This file contains the input data that we'll use to evaluate your program.  say.out contains the output as expected given the input in say.in

You may implement your solution in Java, C#, C++, Python, or Go.
